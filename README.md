# Data Science Job Salaries Analysis

## Introduction

As an aspiring data analyst, I have undertaken a data analysis project to gain valuable insights into salaries and job market trends for data science professionals. The analysis is based on the "Data Science Job Salaries" dataset sourced from Kaggle, which contains information on salaries, experience levels, employment types, and geographic distributions.

## Description of the Dataset

The "Data Science Job Salaries" dataset consists of 11 columns, each providing essential details about data science job salaries. The dataset includes information on the work year, experience level, employment type, job title, salary amount, salary currency, salary in USD, employee residence country, remote work ratio, company location, and company size.

## Purpose of the Analysis

The primary purpose of this analysis is to gain a comprehensive understanding of salary trends in the data science job market and identify key factors influencing compensation. The analysis aims to uncover valuable insights such as salary growth patterns over the years, the impact of experience levels and employment types on salaries, geographic variations in compensation, and the influence of remote work opportunities.

By delving into these aspects, this data analysis project will provide actionable recommendations for both data analysts seeking job opportunities and employers looking to attract top talent. The findings from this analysis will empower data analysts to make informed decisions about their careers, while employers can tailor their hiring strategies and compensation structures to attract skilled data science professionals effectively.

## Tools and Libraries Used

Throughout this project, I utilized Python programming along with essential data analysis and visualization libraries, including:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Data Exploration

In the data exploration phase, I loaded the "Data Science Job Salaries" dataset into a DataFrame and gained an initial understanding of the data. I examined the dataset's structure, missing values, and summary statistics for numerical columns.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) phase involved in-depth analysis and visualization to gain insights, discover patterns, and identify relationships between variables. Some of the key visualizations performed include:

1. Distribution of Salary: A histogram showing the distribution of salaries, revealing that a large portion of salaries fall within the range of 100-150k dollars.

2. Salary Trends over the Years: A line plot showing the average salary trends over the years, indicating significant salary growth from 2021 onwards.

3. Relationships between Salary and Experience Level: A violin plot illustrating the relationship between salary and experience levels, indicating higher salaries for more experienced professionals.

4. Impact of Employment Type, Remote Work Ratio, and Company Size on Salaries: A bar plot showing the impact of employment type and remote work ratio on salaries, with full-time positions offering the highest earnings.

5. Highest Paying and Lowest Paying Job Titles: Bar plots showcasing the top 10 highest and lowest paying job titles.

6. Job Titles with the Most Employees: A bar plot showing the top 10 job titles with the highest number of employees.

7. Distribution of Experience Levels for Top 4 Job Titles with Most Employees: A count plot displaying the distribution of experience levels for the top 4 job titles with the most employees.

8. Salary Trends Over Years for Top 4 Job Titles with Most Employees: Line plots depicting salary trends over the years for the top 4 job titles with the most employees.

9. Salary Trends over the Years by Experience Level: A line plot illustrating salary trends over the years based on experience levels.

10. Salary Trends over the Years by Employment Type: A line plot showing salary trends over the years based on employment types.

11. Distribution of Salaries across Different Countries: A bar plot displaying the average salary distribution across different countries.

12. Geographic Distribution of Job Opportunities and Company Locations: A scatter plot representing job opportunities and company locations on the map.

## Conclusion

The data analysis project provided valuable insights into salary trends and job market dynamics for data science professionals. The findings can be used by data analysts to make informed career decisions and by employers to attract top talent effectively.

The code and visualizations presented here demonstrate the analysis process and can be further expanded or customized for future studies. The entire analysis and visualization were performed using Python and essential data analysis libraries, making it easily reproducible and adaptable to other datasets or related projects.
